      "title": "MY JOURNEY SO FAR",
      "description": "My career started with a background in Architecture, where I worked for several years. Always curious about technology, I felt the need to go beyond physical plans and projects. I decided to seek an international experience in Portugal, where I recently completed a course in Software Development. During the course, I explored various areas of technology, but it was in UX and UI that I truly found my passion. This field allows me to apply my previous knowledge of design and usability, while engaging in everything I love: interacting with people, creating designs, and designing interfaces, always prioritizing the user experience. Now, after completing my software development course, I am specializing and seeking opportunities in the UX and UI field."
